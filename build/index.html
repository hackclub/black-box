          Looking for information on how to assemble your prize?
          Or maybe you're a curious soul who wants to get involved after the fact?
          <br>
          <b>You're in the right place.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          On this page, you'll find detailed instructions on how to wire up your own Black Box device.
          <br>
          Do it right, and you'll be able to compile code written in <a href="/editor">the editor</a> and run it in the real world.
        </p>
        <p>Ready? Let's go.</p>
        <p class="muted">(Something wrong with this guide? <a href="https://github.com/hackclub/black-box/issues" target="_blank">Open an issue!</a>)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h1 class="red">What you need</h1>
        <h4 class="red">Caveat emptor</h4>
        <p>You will need the following parts in order to follow these instructions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Raspberry Pi Pico</b> or other RP2040-based microcontroller (1&times;)</li>
          <li><b>8x8 LED matrix</b>, common cathode (1&times;)</li>
          <li><b>Momentary pushbutton</b> (5&times;)</li>
          <li><b>PS1240 piezo buzzer</b> or similar (1&times;)</li>
          <li><b>Breadboard(s)</b> (see note)</li>
          <li><b>Jumper wire</b> (30&times;)</li>
          <li><b>USB micro B cable</b> (1&times;)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you are a <b>prize recipient</b>, meaning you completed a submission for Black Box before the deadline, you will have all of these parts already.
          <br>
          If not, you will have to source them yourself. <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/" target="_blank">Adafruit</a> is one retailer which can provide all of the parts.
        </p>
        <p>Depending on where your parts are coming from, some aspects may be different:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Prize recipients will be receiving three half-size breadboards; however, if you're sourcing from elsewhere, you may find it cheaper to buy two full-size breadboards instead.</li>
          <li>
            Prize recipients will be receiving an 8x8 LED matrix with the following pin assignments:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Rows:</b> 9-14-8-12-1-7-2-5</li>
              <li><b>Columns:</b> 13-3-4-10-6-11-15-16</li>
            </ul>
            If you're sourcing from elsewhere, your matrix may instead have the following pin assignments:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Rows:</b> 1-2-3-4-12-11-10-9</li>
              <li><b>Columns:</b> 5-6-7-8-16-15-14-13</li>
            </ul>
            If needed, you can check the datasheet for your matrix to find out which one you have.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h1 class="yellow">The shape</h1>
        <h4 class="yellow">Vexata quaestio</h4>
        <p>There are multiple possible ways to lay out your device.</p>
        <p>
          If your LED matrix is <b>0.8" square,</b> you will be able to assemble your device using either two half-size breadboards or one full-size breadboard.
          <br>
          However, if your LED matrix is <b>1.2" square</b>, you will need to use either three half-size breadboards or two full-size breadboards to account for the difference in size.
          <br>
          If you are a <b>prize recipient,</b> your LED matrix is <b>1.2" square.</b>
        </p>
        <p>The rest of this guide will assume that you are a <b>prize recipient.</b></p>
        <p>
          Take two of your half-size breadboards, and remove the <b>bottom</b> power rail from each one. Then, connect both of them together horizontally.
          <br>
          You can use a small utility knife to push back the plastic underneath the breadboards in order to remove the rails, but take care not to remove the plastic completely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, take the third breadboard, and remove the <b>top</b> power rail from it.
          <br>
          Then, connect it vertically to the breadboard on the right.
        </p>
        <!-- TODO: there definitely needs to be an image here -->
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h1 class="green">The left half</h1>
        <h4 class="green">Sic parvis magna</h4>
        <p>Let's assemble the left half of the device first, including the Raspberry Pi Pico and the piezo buzzer.</p>
        <p>
          Place your Raspberry Pi Pico at the far left of the first board, with half of the pins on either side of the ravine in the middle, and gently push it into the board until it is fully seated. The Pico's USB micro B port should be on the left.
          <br>
          Then, place your piezo buzzer in the remaining space on the first board, making sure its two pins are in line with each other horizontally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, let's add a few wires to the first board.
          <br>
          You will want to keep the following image around from now on:
        </p>
        <img src="images/pico-pinout.svg">
        <p>The guide will refer to specific pins on this diagram.</p>
        <p>
          Connect pin <b>38</b> on the Pico to <b class="blue">ground (-)</b> on the top of the first board.
          <br>
          Then, connect the <b>left</b> pin of the piezo buzzer to <b class="blue">ground (-)</b> as well.
          <br>
          Finally, connect the <b>right</b> pin of the piezo buzzer to pin <b>4</b> on the Pico.
        </p>
        <p>All of the other components will be placed on the second board.</p>
